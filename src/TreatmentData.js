There are four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity to that serotype but not to the others. A person can therefore contract an infection up to four times, once for each serotype. A higher risk of severe dengue is linked to secondary infections with a distinct serotype.",
